## 🧠 **Core Features**

### 📊 **1. High Earnings Growth**
The High Earnings Growth approach emphasizes identifying companies with consistently robust earnings growth over multiple periods. This method seeks out businesses that demonstrate operational efficiency, strong demand for their products or services, and competitive advantages that enable them to scale profitably. Companies meeting these criteria are often market leaders with clear visibility into their future growth trajectories, making them ideal candidates for inclusion in the AlphaFlex portfolio.

By prioritizing sustained profitability, this screening method ensures the ETF captures firms that can consistently reinvest in innovation and expansion, driving long-term shareholder value. Such businesses typically outperform their peers, not only in bull markets but also during periods of economic uncertainty, due to their resilient financial structures and clear strategic visions.

---

### 📈 **2. High Sales Growth**
High Sales Growth focuses on companies that exhibit significant revenue expansion alongside financial prudence. This approach identifies firms with the ability to scale operations, capture market share, and maintain fiscal discipline, as evidenced by healthy balance sheets and high returns on equity. The methodology also accounts for management quality and their ability to sustain this growth while managing external risks effectively.

This screening process highlights companies that are often innovators or disruptors in their respective industries. By capturing firms with consistent top-line growth, the ETF ensures exposure to businesses with strong underlying demand dynamics, providing a critical foundation for future earnings potential and long-term investment success.

---

### 🤝 **3. Consistent Growth on a Bullish Trend**
The Consistent Growth on a Bullish Trend method leverages both fundamental and technical metrics to identify stocks with a proven track record of earnings expansion and positive market momentum. This dual-focus strategy emphasizes companies that not only deliver strong financial performance but also exhibit a robust upward price trajectory, signaling sustained investor confidence. By blending these factors, the ETF ensures a balanced selection of resilient, well-managed firms that thrive across market cycles.

This method's emphasis on consistency is particularly crucial for mitigating portfolio volatility. Stocks identified through this approach tend to outperform due to their ability to attract long-term institutional investors, reinforcing their price stability. The ETF benefits from aligning with such companies, which have both the operational excellence and market perception to deliver steady growth.

---

### 🛡️ **4. CANSLIM**
Inspired by William O’Neil’s investment framework, the CANSLIM method combines growth, momentum, and operational excellence. This approach identifies companies with a blend of earnings and sales growth, positive market sentiment, and strong technical performance. It also considers management quality and broader industry trends to ensure a comprehensive assessment of each stock's potential.

By leveraging this holistic methodology, AlphaFlex taps into a balanced mix of high-growth opportunities and momentum-driven performance. CANSLIM is particularly effective in capturing stocks that are at the forefront of innovation and market leadership, providing the ETF with exposure to businesses that are well-positioned to benefit from both macroeconomic trends and company-specific drivers.
